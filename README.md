# PyCOILS
A Python implementation of the classic COILS program

## Motivation

## Development

ToDo
* [ ] Simple profiling
* [ ] GitHub page

Potential optimizations:
* [ ] Flatten dictionary
* [ ] Avoid creating an empty array for window_scores every window

What I will not Do:
* Exporting results, such as to .csv, .pkl, or .png -> If you are running this program you know how do this yourself. It would be trivial to add code to do this, but also, it would add unnecessary complexity to the PyCOILS code, which is meant just to be an implementation of the COILS algorithm.
* Command-Line Interface (CLI) -> If you are running COILS predictions several times a day, and want a convenient way of accessing this functionality, see the point above.
